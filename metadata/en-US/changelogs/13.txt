Global Search across Recordings and Videos.
Search looks in any field in those tables (i.e. Title, Character, Actor, Channel Number or Call Sign, Category, Recording Group, etc).
This feature is highly dependent on your recording and video metadata being up to date.
Actor/Character search is limited to MythTV Backend v0.28+ and only for recordings at this time.
