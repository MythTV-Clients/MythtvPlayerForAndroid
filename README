MythTV Player allows you to browse and play your recordings and videos
stored on your MythTV Backend.

If you plan to use this application, you are required to have a fully
functioning MythTV Backend version v0.27+.  If you are interested in
learning more about MythTV, check their web site at http://mythtv.org.

MythTV Player will natively play HTTP Live Streams transcoded by the
MythTV Backend.  However, you have the option to launch a recording
or video with an external player. We recommend VLC for Android.

The MythTV Services API does not provide a method to watch LiveTV,
therefore, this app can't.
