MythTV Player allows you to browse and play your recordings and videos
stored on your MythTV Backend on your Android Phone or Tablet and on Android TV.

If you plan to use this application, you are required to have a fully
functioning MythTV Backend version v0.28+.  If you are interested in
learning more about MythTV, check their web site at http://mythtv.org.

MythTV Player will natively play HTTP Live Streams transcoded by the
MythTV Backend.  However, you have the option to launch a recording
or video with an external player. We recommend VLC for Android.

MythTV Player supports playback on Chromecast devices. Recordings 
always need to be transcoded to HLS prior to watching an episode on
a Chromecast devices. Videos can be played natively on a Chromecast
device depending on how they were originally encoded. Check video
compatibility on the Google Cast support page

The MythTV Services API does not provide a method to watch LiveTV,
therefore, this app can't.
